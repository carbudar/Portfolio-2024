    <h1>Website 1: Deserted State of Mind</h1>

        Create a network of pages as a non-linear poem. Each word or phrase is linked to another page that expands upon this poem or story.
    <br><br>
    I had previously wrote this piece of creative writing which visualizes the struggles of a solitary battle with insomnia and over-thinking, and how the momentary experience can affect the subject.

    For this project, I split this poem into three independent parts; depending on how the user navigate through the page, every individual will experience the poem differently. 
    The writing is re-wrote to make sense disregarding the sequence of the thread. My main objective when designing the webpage is to evoke two distinctive feelings when reading it through a digital webpage compared to reading it on paper.

</p>

<h2>Webpage Explained</h2>
<img src="Port illustrations/web1 1.png" class="webImg">
<br> <p><b>Home page | Page 1</b><br>
    This home page is made up of the background, header, title, and the three buttons. The background is an image created in Adobe Illustrator with my photograph blurred in the background and grid lines.
    <br><br>
    The three buttons turn orange when hovered over, indicating interactiveness and encourage visitors to click on it; which will direct users to one of the three next pages.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="Port illustrations/web1 2.png" class="webImg">
<br> <p><b>Page 2</b><br>
    The second page contains the first part of the poem. It has a video background of an animation which I created in p5.js, visualizing the color transitions described in the writing. The back button brings the viewers to the home page.
<br><br>
<img src="Port illustrations/web1 3.png" class="webImg">
<br> <p><b>Page 3</b><br>
    The third page contains the second part of the poem which is laid out over a maze-like template. The background, which is made up of a blurred eye photograph and a collection of lines, was illustrated in Adobe Illustrator. I approached the design of this third page based on the lines of the poem.<br><br>
<img src="Port illustrations/web1 4.png" class="webImg">
<br> <p><b>Page 4</b><br>
    This last page contains the last section of the poem which is laid out in different allignments. I tried exploring different allignments in css and used a video background for this as well. Lastly, I also brought in a squiggly graphic which was also made in Adobe Illustrator.<br><br>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
    As this was my first exposure to webpage design, the concept of relative units were still foreign, hence the unresponsive sizing of elements in the website. However, I felt like it was a great practice and 
    introduction into html and css as I was able to learn a lot of new concepts in an effective way.</p>
