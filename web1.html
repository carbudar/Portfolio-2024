    <p id="textContent">Puppy Vision<br>
        In the summer, I adopted a little puppy named Charli. By spending plenty of time training and trying to understand her, 
        I came across a study which mentioned that dogs are only able to see yellow and blue. This made me realized how Charli 
        is mostly intrigued by her blue blankets and toys which made me feel obligated to get her all blue everything.
        The main purpose of this iteration is to help me put myself in Charli's shoes and see colors the way she sees it. This way, 
        I can sort of pick and choose objects that looks interesting accoding to her vision.

    Graphic Visualization<br>
        Lastly, when exploring the possibilities of this createCapture() feature, I was inspired by the statics in the example starter code from the 
        previous class activity. I found that a lot of fiction movies has special effects on it to keep the viewers immeresed and to convey the vibe 
        of the story better. It also reminded me of those night vision cameras that people use in horror documentaries or movies which made the visuals 
        look scarier than how it actually is.
        I created this unstable visual for the camera to recreate those documentary-style cameras. I though that this playful approach was really fun to make and to explore!

<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p>I started the design process by sketching the ideas out. Since this camera is color-based, there were not much 
    things that I added to the sketch. I then tried to write a code for it in p5js by adjusting the pixels. Once that 
    was done, I thought of exploring ascii characters, following a tutorial which I found on youtube. At first, I had 
    a few different characters with varying shapes and sizes that makes up the image, however I did not really like 
    how that looked as it seems too messy. I decided to change it to just one character (@) since it is a very dense 
    character, making the video look more full and neat. I resized the character size to distort the image enough, but 
    not too much until the image is unrecognizable. I also used arrays and forloops to create the repitition of the 
    character 'tiles'. <br><br>
    With this camera, I expect to be able to see similarly to how Charli sees her world and try to accomodate her with 
    that. I tried showing some pictures of her favorite cartoons and toys, which surprisingly the colors looks very 
    similar to how it looks like to the human eye. In simple, I want this camera to be sort of an artistic translator 
    between dogs and humans to put us in the same page when interacting with toys or colors by showing it toys and 
    objects as the main camera subject to read the colors based on puppy's vision.
