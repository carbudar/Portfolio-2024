    <h1>Time Keeper</h1>
    <h2>P5.js (2023)</h2>
    <br>
    <p id="textContent">
        Conventional clocks mark seconds, minutes, and hours according to a 24 hour cycle. This segmented, discrete, and regimented approach to parsing time is not universal in terms of capturing and measuring of experience. 
        <br><br>
        Everytime I am working on something, time has never felt constant. At times, it would fly by in a 
        blink of an eye. At some other times, I would feel like I am frozen in time. I also found myself 
        checking the numbers on the clock constantly.<br>
        With this time-keeper clock experimentation, I visualize the 
        difference in the speed of time that I usually experience. The animation also helps me experience 
        time as faster or slower whenever I need it to. In a way, I hope that this design could act as an 
        instrument to a psycological time control.

<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p>
    I designed a few different concepts of time-keeping and explored various possibilites in conversing time unorthodoxly. 
    I ended up with my second sketch as it resembles the planet rotation which is also a way of telling time. One part 
    of the p5.js sketch is at a slower pace with more calming color, while the other is at a faster pace and a louder 
    color. I wanted to convey the relation between the speed of time and emotion.
    <b>Ideation and Sketches</b><br>
    
    <div class="inbloomSketch">
    <img src="Port illustrations/time img 1.jpeg"><br>
    <i>(sketch 1: moon phase)</i>
    <br>
    <img src="Port illustrations/time img 2.jpeg"><br>
    <i>(sketch 2: clock/ dynamic timer to meditate/study)</i>
    <br>
    <img src="Port illustrations/time img 3.jpeg"><br>
    <i>(sketch 3: dial)</i>
</div>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<b>Dial when mouse is on the left side of the screen:</b><br>
    Slower paced<br>
    Orbit full rotation: 30 seconds<br>
    Color change in ring: 5 minutes<br>
    Background color change: 3 minutes<br><br>
<b>Dial when mouse is on the right side of the screen:</b><br>
Faster paced<br>
Orbit full rotation: 5 seconds<br>
Color change in ring: 15 seconds<br>
Background color change: 1 minute<br>
</p>

<h2>
    Reflection
</h2>
<p>
    All in all, I think the whole design process sparked more of my interest on creating timed animation 
    in p5.js. I was able to learn more techniques to accomodate my ideas. Though 
    I sometimes came across some bugs in my code, I was able to fix it by learning my code more thoroughly.
