    <h1>Rock Paper Scissor</h1>
    <h2>P5.js (2023)</h2>

    <p id="textContent">
       This rock paper scissor generator will generate a hand sign randomly with a mouse-click as a trigger.
</p>
<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p>
    <b>Ideation and Sketches</b><br>
    I started the design process by ideating and sketching several different iteration of a moving image. 
    After going through multiple ideas, I sketched the rock paper scissors de down on the grid template provided. 
    I then thought about how I can achieve the concept that I desired. I started illustrating the hand signs 
    (rock, paper, scissors) on Adobe Illustator and exported them as png images. I then insert the image in p5.js 
    along with the pixelated character which I illustrated in p5.js using rect().
    <div class="inbloomSketch">
    <img src="Port illustrations/rps img 1.png"><br>
    <i>(sketch)</i>
    <br>

    <i>(Adobe Illustrator sketch)</i>
    <br>
    <img src="Port illustrations/rps img 3.png"><br>
    <i>(Color Palette)</i>
</div>
<br>
I then incorporated the <b>technical components</b>, such as:<br>
<ul>
<li>User-defined variables,</li>
<li>random(), and</li>
<li>mouseX and mouseY, mousePressed() or keyPressed().</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>
    Problems I Encountered
</h2>
<ol>
   <li> I tried using mouseClicked() to generate the random hand icons, however it would show up for a short second before it disappear.</li>
   <li> In contrary, when I use mousePressed() it would show the images for longer period of time but shows all the array rapidly (all images switching constantly in random)</li>
   <li>I was able to make the hands shows for a long time after a click one by one, but it stacks on top of each other (the older images does not go away)</li>
   <li> Action is not responsive sometimes.</li>
   <li> Lastly, I had to illustrate the pixelated images manually one by one, is there a more effective way to achieve this style? (maybe put in image from Adobe Illustrator)</li>
</ol>

<h2>
    Reflection
</h2>
<p>
    Overall, I think the design process was very immersive as there were multiple things that I can learn throughout 
    my process of developing the interactive illustration. Due to my lack of knowledge and experience, I believe the 
    code that I came up with was not the most effective. Not only that it took more time to create the pixelated 
    illustration, I think the long code made the interaction (mouseClicked()) not super responsive, which inspired 
    me to explore more ways to improve that. Lastly, the biggest challenge that I faced was making the mouseClicked() 
    interaction, I could not figure out how to make the hand signs stay for longer, which was more ideal to my liking. 
    Even so, I think that this was a good practice result and I was able to aquire new skills.
