            I realized that time is something that everyone experiences differently. My

perception of time might differ from how you think of it even though we have the same

amount of hours in a day. I think time has its own surrealist concept to it as time could

feel faster or slower depending on what you do, where you are, and who and how you

spend it with.<br><br>
As in philosophy, time is metaphysical,

which means it could not be defined materially. The future is now the present, and the

present is now in the past. This could affect the distortion of time while spent with more

people; the more things that are said and done, the shorter the gaps between the past,

the present, and the future.<br><br>
After reflecting on these ideas, I realized that not only that time is non tangible, it is also

very abstract. I believe time could not be told by the 12 numbers on a clock and mostly

based on intuition due to its abstraction.

    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <p>
        I was inspired by some studies (by Harvard and University of Michigan) that analyzed why the time feels like it passes by quickly as we grow older. When we are younger, a year will feel longer since it makes up a big percentage of our live, however as we grow older a year feels more brief as it is just a small chunk of our life.
        <br><br>

        I wanted to visualize this study through my design object, hence the numbered dial which will affect the speed of the spinner. I want it to resemble a clock or a timer though I want to shift away from the traditional clock display. So instead of looking at it to tell the time, I want people to look at it as an instrument that visually communicates the pace/ speed of life based on the age (in the dial).</p>

<h2>How It Works?</h2>
<p>This work is made up of two parts, the spinner, and the dial. The dial (on the right) is connected to a potentiometer which will affect the speed of the spinner. The numbers on the dial (starts from 0-100 in increments of 10s) denotes the human age, the smaller the number, the slower the spinner spins. </p>
