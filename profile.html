        <h2>Hi, Welcome To My Digital Gallery</h2>
        <p>
            If this is your first time visiting, treat this gallery as a fun laboratory or playground where exploration and experimentation take place! I am thrilled that you travelled all the way to my corner of the internet.
             Before anything, allow me to introduce myself: I'm <b>Carla Budar</b>, currently a student in Parsons School of Design in New York City, majoring in Design and Technology. I am an aspiring a multidimensional creator with a passion for weaving magic through pixels, circuits, and innovative design. 
             <br><br>
             In my design process, sparks has always been an essential aspect. Starting with the spark of inspiration I got while ideating for a design work, to the spark of excitement when the user-testing process goes through smoothly, or even the little spark of electricity that accidentally ignite during the soldering process.
             I enjoy sparkling my white canvas with user-centric digital experiences that not only dazzle the eye but also resonate with the soul with my focus in <b>website design, physical computing, and product design.</b> <br> <br>
             With a blend of creativity, technical expertise, and a passion for innovation, I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of design and technology. 
             So, join me on this journey of exploration and discovery, and let's create something extraordinary together!
