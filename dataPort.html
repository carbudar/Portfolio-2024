    <h1>Data Portrait</h1>
    <h2>P5.js (2023)</h2>
    <br>
    <p id="textContent">
        For this project, I spent a week tracking my personal habit to create a data-self portrait. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Data farming constraints:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Need to collect 20 ~ 50 data points.</li>
            <li>Record the data onto a numbered list every time it happens.</li>
            <li>Translate the list into array in p5.js. </li>
            <li>Animate the data self-portrait.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>

    <h2>Data Points</h2>
    <img src="Port illustrations/data track.png" id="dataTrackImg">
    <p>I tracked the social interactions that I do each day for a week. The main data points are:</p>
    <ol>
<li>How many people do I interact with throughout that day?</li>
<li>How long do I spend to go out and socialize with people in real life per day? (in minutes)</li>
<li>How much time do I spend talking to people on the phone? (in minutes)</li>
</ol>

</p>
<h3>Arrays</h3>
<p>totalPeople = [9, 9, 21, 13, 11, 8, 20];<br>
    inPerson = [180, 200, 330, 210, 165, 170, 720];<br>
    virtual = [541, 431, 489, 204, 530, 522, 116];</p>

<h2>How to read the data portrait?</h2>
<p>
    This sketch is divided into <b>7 different parts</b> (shown by the guidelines in the background); the first section 
    determines the first day which was Wednesday. The section goes up until the last day, which is Tuesday and 
    the days change based on the mouse location. The density and the size of the<b>orange form</b> is the amount of 
    time that I spent talking to people on the phone (in minutes), while the density and size or the <b>purple form</b> 
    is based on the total minutes I spent interacting with people in real life. Lastly, the <b>row of squares</b> that
    travels from left to right shows the amount of people I interacted with per day.
</p>

<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p>
    Originally I wanted to make my data portrait in a more geometric shapes with a dynamic background. However, 
    while working on it in p5js, I started exploring more with the for loop and ended up with an interesting form. 
    I also played around with the fill, alpha color, and stroke weight to add more character. <br><br>

At first, I grouped the codes in fucntion based on days, but I realized that the code ended up being long and 
repetitive, with the array being the only difference in every function. I then tried to make a new function and 
making the arrays as the arguments in the new function. It worked in the beginning, but the animation ended up 
not being too smooth. I think this might probably due to a faulty code and I will look more into it. I also 
realized that I could seperate each element into its own function and calling them in new functions based on the days.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
    I think the full process of creating this data portrait revolves in exploring the visuals and understanding array. 
    At first, I was not sure if I used the array properly, but at the end I was able to slowly grasp the concept of 
    arrays. I should also learn to minimize my code and make it more effective and not repetitive in the future.
<br><br>
    <b>What did you learn about yourself through the process of self-tracking?</b> 
    <br>
    After acquiring the data, I noticed that 
    generally, there is a big contrast between my social life physically and online. I was shocked at how much time I spent talking on the phone and how I would usually go home straight after class. Though this data tracking was done for an assignment, I felt like I was missing out big time and was moved to start socializing more.
    <br><br>
    <b>What was gained / lost through the process of data visualization?</b>
    <br>
    With the amount of data and numbers that was collected, I wanted to show them in the most understandable and straight forward way possible. However, throughout the process I realized that some functionality are more complicated to do so I had to change my ideas and adjust with the programming concepts that I have learnt in this class. Though I am excited to explore and develop this (or similar) project further.</p>
