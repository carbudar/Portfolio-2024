    <h1>Website 4: Are You Bored?</h1>
    <h2>HTML, CSS, JavaScript (2024)</h2>

    <p id="textContent">
        I wanted to create an divination that seems random but is also influence by some sort of pattern. I am using the user's choice of three cards as an input to then give them an activity idea to do when they are bored using the bored API.
<br><br>
        In this iteration, I used the 'type' endpoint from the JSON to group the recomendations based on the card patterns. These card patterns were influenced by a cultural fabric design from Indonesia called 'Batik'. Each pattern have their meanings and interpretation in the traditional beliefs; I was inspired by these philosophical interpretation and decided to use that as the parameter of the output, similar to card readings.
        <br><br>
        <ul>
        <li>The first pattern was derived from the pattern called <b>'Megamendung Batik'</b> which was believed as a symbol of calmness, freedom, and peace of mind. I paired this pattern with the endpoint 'type = relaxation'.</li>

        <li>The second pattern was derived from the pattern called <b>'Parang Batik'</b> which was believed as a symbol of strong-mindness, firm, and dependable, which was also only worn by kings and men in a higher position. I paired this pattern with the endpoint 'type = busywork'.</li>

        <li>The third pattern was derived from the pattern called  <b>'Kawung Batik'</b> which was believed as a symbol of holistic knowledge and a cycle of life due to its circular pattern. I paired this pattern with the endpoint 'type = education'.</li>
</ul>
