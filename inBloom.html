        Design and code an animating optical illusion and consider its deployment.
        <br><br>

        When I was younger, my grandmother would always buy me and my siblings spirograph templates, which is a plastic stencil with circle cut out with ridges on them. We would trace lines in it using the given template and make all kinds of cool spirals. I always found it facinating how multiple lines could make a form that looks three dimensional. I also liked the flower-like shapes that they created; it was one of the coolest thing that I know how to do as a kid.
        With this assignment, I wanted to recreate a similar effect to the spirographs by repeating multiple ellipses on top of each other which will then create a parametrized form.
</p>
<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p>
    <b>Ideation and Sketches</b><br>
    Apart from the concept that I went with, there were several other ideas that I came up with, including:
    <div class="inbloomSketch">
    <img src="Port illustrations/inbloom sketch 1.jpeg"><br>
    <i>Sketch 1: Circle pattern with different oppacities</i>
    <br>
    <img src="Port illustrations/inbloom sketch 2.jpeg"><br>
    <i>Sketch 2: Tunnel illusion</i>
    <br>
    <img src="Port illustrations/inbloom sketch 4.jpeg"><br>
    <i>Sketch 3: Three dimensional box</i>
    <br>
    <img src="Port illustrations/inbloom sketch 5.jpeg"><br>
    <i>Sketch 4: Spirals inspired by spirographs (final idea)</i>
</div>
</p>

<br>

<h2>
    Coding Process
</h2>
<p>
    After finalizing my idea for the chosen consept, I started sketching the form in p5js. I started with an ellipse and using the nested for loops to create multiples of the ellipse. I also used rotate() under the for loops to rotate and duplicate the group of ellipse. When trying to make an animation using IF/ELSE, I found it to be quite challenging as I could only get it to work if there were only one ellipse group. I was able to make it move from left to right, though I did not quite like the way it looks.

<h2>
    Reflection
</h2>
<p>
    <b>Describe the process of researching, designing, and fine-tuning your optical illusion. How might your optical illusion get deployed in the world around you?<br>
         May it be incorporated into a browser extension? <br> 
         Can it possibly be turned into a piece of wearableLinks?</b>
         <br><br>
        When working on this optical illusion assignment, my process was full of exploring and experimenting as the For Loop concept was new to me. 
        I liked the idea and concept that I had which made the process immersive. Though there are more things that I do not understand yet in the concept of for 
        loops and nested for loops, I believe that I can use for loops in various different ways. I also found myself going back and adjusting the numbers in my for 
        loop to meet my desired visual aesthetic on the sketch.
        I think this kind of optical illusion can be used as interactive graphics in websites and social medias. I also think this graphic could look cool as a projection installation. Due to its repetitive patterns, in my opinion, this optical illusion design can be transformed to various different medias and mediums (not limited to digital).
