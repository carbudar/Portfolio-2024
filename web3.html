        While thinking about a concept that I resonante to work with, I had difficulties pin-pointing a topic that might work well to build a community tool for. However, self-reflection is something that I do often as a wellness and mindfulness practice that was encouraged by my psychiatrist to maintain a stable and balanced mental state. I thought about the questions that helped me understand my behaviours daily and decided to make a form-like website for more people to benefit from it.
        <br><br>
        This webpage should help users log their emotions, sleeping schedule, and other behavioral patterns, almost like a diary. These logs should also be stored locally and be available to use for review.

<h2>Reflection</h2>

    Though I think that the process of creating a webpage using all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was quite challenging as 
    there were a lot of consideration (aesthetic and technical) that needs to be done, I think that it was fun as 
    I get to learn and explore all the different possibilities in creating a website. I had fun exploring the 
    different form elements and choosing which one fits the related prompts and questions best. Throughout 
    the whole process too, I found myself getting confused about the concept and having to research more on 
    that which kind of encouraged me to do further studies (additional to the brief in-class activities). All 
    in all, since this was the first "complete" website that I have ever made, it helped me understand the basic 
    details that goes on in a somewhat interactive website and I am very interested in exploring more!
