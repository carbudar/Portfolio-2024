    <h1>Website 2: PERSPECTIVES</h1>
    <h2>HTML, CSS (2024)</h2>
    <br>
    <p id="textContent">
        With this website, I wanted to explore the perspectives of a viewpoint. When first thinking about 
        the concept, I thought about the way of looking at something physically; but then I realized that 
        a perspective is also translated as an opinion. I was inspired to play around the idea of comparing 
        and contrasting people's viewpoint on a space and how that space actually feels like. I chose to 
        capture the Madison Square Park and Flatiron area as I personally live around the area and have 
        some specific biases on that space, so I found it to be interesting to know other people's thoughts 
        on the area.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
    <b>Descibe your object or space. Why did you choose it? How do you hope your website shapes the viewer's perspective of your space or object?</b><br>
I chose Madison Square Park as my space because I lean towards it whenever me and my friends decide for a place to meet. It might be because I live near it or because of the things that I can find there, but some of my friends have their own preference in NYC parks. In this Assignment 2, I decided to interview some park's visitors and look into online reviews about the park to see their perspectives on the space while showcasing the views available in the space.
<br><br>
<b>Describe your design process. Why did you design your site the way you did?</b><br>
While determining the aesthetics of the site, I wanted it to have a more professional yet laid back feel - reflecting the Madison Square Park and Flatiron neighborhood. I took inspirations from the Madison Square Park Concervancy website, yet making it more interactive to engage with the users.
<br><br>
<b>What technical challenges did you encounter while making your website? How did you overcome them?</b><br>
<ul>
<li>I had troubles making the up and down button, which take the users to the next pages, to appear over the whole pages due to the cascading nature of the CSS. Everything was jumbled together because I had to go back and forth adding and subtracting things.
I was able to fix this by determining the z-index which pushes the buttons furthest up of the page.</li>

<li>Another trouble that I came across is contolling the layout positions of the contents inside the grids and flexbox.
I added more columns or rows as I go if I need to space things out further to overcome this problem.</li>

<li>Lastly, I was exploring transition on CSS where I could not understand the differences between transition, animation, and keyframes.
I watched and looked up lots of tutorials online to help be better understand the concept. I was able to implement transitions and keyframes in this website.</li>
</ul>
<b>What technical skills did you learn or improve upon while completing this project?</b><br>
Through this project, I was able to learn how to make simple transitions and keyframes in a website using HTML and CSS. I was also able to practice using the CSS grid to create layouts and better understand the concept of parent-child elements.
<br><br>
Other than CSS and HTML skills, I also learnt how to edit videos to create a stopmotion-like effect in Premiere Pro which I used to make the background videos. I also explored a resource by Google Earth Studio, where I created the drone-like videos for some of the pages.
