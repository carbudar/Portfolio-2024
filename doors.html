    <h1>Looking In Looking Out</h1>
    <h2>Unity + Arduino (2024)</h2>
    <br>
    <p id="textContent">
        How does perspective of looking in and looking out differ? How does society agree on what is right and what is wrong? Looking in? looking out? 
    <br><br>
    This project was my first attempt in building a projected immersive environment, employing both a physical and digital experience. I was inspired by the prompt looking in looking out as 
    a tool of reflection as well as escapism. While doors can lead you into a space, it can also transport you out beyond it. With my partner and classmate, Michelle Xing, we were able to cohesively build a media where people could 
    enter a space of reflection beyond the tangible world. 
</p>

<h2>
    Design Process
</h2>
<p>
    <b>Ideation</b><br>
    We wanted this project to convey portals while still resembling spaces that people are familiar with. Our objective is based on how people feel emotions and how can these porttals bring people back to these specific feelings.
    We chose three main rooms which we then built in Unity, including:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>
           <b>Hospital</b>
        </li>
        <p>
            A hospital is the place full of feelings and emotion depending on each individual's experience. It can resemble joy from birth, yet the sorrow of death. The warmth of family, yet the coldness of loneliness. <br>
            We depicted this hospital room empty so that the emotions triggered are solely based on the space and not influenced by the activity and life in the hospital. We wanted the viewers to relive their experience here, transporting them to the specific time where a big experience took place, which normally is not actively being thought of.
        </p><br>
        <li>
           <b>Cinema</b>
        </li>
        <p>
            Similarly to the hospital, a cinema experience can vary based on the kind of movie we are watching, or the arcade games there, 
            or even the movie theater snacks. With this scene, we hoped to bring nostalgia of anticipating a movie in the cinema or even 
            the feeling of escapism, immersed in the movie scene.
        </p><br>
        <li>
            <b>Hallway of doors</b>
        </li>
        <p>
            When thinking of hallway of doors, there are multiple possibility of what it can be. It can bring one back to a vacation, on the way to check out a hotel room for the first time; or to a movie scene where the main character is in a spiral choosing which door is going to bring them th ebest fate. 
            Based on the user's experience with this familiar scene, it can form very distinctive experiences that are incomparable to other users.
        </p>
    </ul>
        <p>All in all, these different scenes which are capable of housing such contrasting experiences are chosen to evoke different thoughts, emotions, and memories of the users entering.</p>

        <h2>
            Building Process
        </h2>
        <p>
            After building the environment in Unity, I connected each keypress function(which brings the scene from the door into the scene) to a physical button through a micro-controller. In this project, I used an Arduino Leonardo as it is recognized as a usb communication input, similarly to a usb powered keyboard or mouse.
            <br>
            I also built the physical model using foam-core boards and embedding the buttons onto the model which represents doorbells; this physical interaction helps the user feel more connected to the experience as their actions (pressing the button) act as a trigger to the video in contrast to just watching a digital video.
